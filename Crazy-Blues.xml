        <mental-health who="self" state="negative">I can't sleep at night I can't eat a
            bite</mental-health>
        <cause fault="abuse">'Cause the man I love He don't treat me right</cause>
    </verse>

    <verse><relationship atmosphere="negative">He makes me feel so blue</relationship> I don't know
        what to do <action present="yes" who="self" type="direct"> Sometime I sit and sigh And then
            begin to cry </action>
        <cause fault="abandonment">'Cause my best friend Said his last goodbye</cause></verse>

    <verse>There's a change in the ocean Change in the deep blue sea, my baby I'll tell you folks,
        there ain't no change in me My love for that man will always be</verse>

    <verse>Now <action present="yes" who="self" type="direct">I can read his letters</action> I sure
        can't read his mind I thought he's lovin' me <cause fault="abandonment">He's leavin' all the
            time</cause> Now I see my poor love was blind</verse>

    <verse><mental-health who="self" state="negative">Now I got the crazy blues</mental-health>
        <cause fault="abandonment">Since my baby went away</cause> I ain't got no time to lose I
        must find him today</verse>

    <verse>Now the doctor's gonna do all that he can But what you're gonna need is an undertaker man
            <mental-health who="self" state="negative">I ain't had nothin' but bad news Now I got
            the crazy blues</mental-health></verse>
