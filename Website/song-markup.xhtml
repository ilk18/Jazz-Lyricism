         <h2>Nobody Knows when You're Down and Out</h2>
         <h2>Bessie Smith</h2>
         <p>
            <br/>Once I lived a life of a millionaire
            <br/>Spendin' my money, I didn't care
            <br/>I carried my friends out for a good time
            <br/>Buy bootleg liquor, champagne, and wine
            </p>
         <p>
            <br/>When I begin to fall so low
            <br/>I didn't have a friend and no place to go
            <br/>But if I ever get my hands on a dollar again
            <br/>I'm gonna hold on to it 'til them eagles grin
            </p>
         <p>
            <br/>Nobody knows you
            <br/>When you down and out
            <br/>In my pocket not one penny
            <br/>And my friends, I haven't any
            </p>
         <p>
            <br/>But if I ever get on my feet again
            <br/>And I'll meet my long-lost friend
            <br/>It's mighty strange without a doubt
            <br/>Nobody knows you when you down and out
            <br/>I mean, when you down and out
            </p>
         <p>
            <br/>Mmm
            <br/>When you down and out
            <br/>Mmm, not one penny
            <br/>And my friends, I haven't any
            </p>
         <p>
            <br/>Mmm, and I fell so low
            <br/>Nobody wants me 'round their door
            <br/>Mmm, without a doubt
            <br/>No man can use you when you down and out
            <br/>I mean when you down and out
            </p>

            <br/>She plainly stated she was aggravated
            <br/>And she shouted out to him
            </p>
         <p>
            <br/>Aggravatin' papa, don't you try to two-time me

            </p>
         <p>
            <br/>Aggravatin' papa, I'll do anything you say
            <br/>Anything you say
            <br/>But when you go struttin', do your strut around my way
            <br/>So papa, just treat me pretty, be nice and kind
            <br/>The way you treated me will make me lose my mind
            <br/>Aggravatin' papa, don't you try to two-time me
            </p>
         <p>
            <br/>Just treat me pretty, be nice and sweet
            <br/>I got a darn forty-four that don't repeat
            <br/>Aggravatin' papa, don't you try to two-time me

            <br/>I can't sleep at night
            <br/>I can't eat a bite
            <br/>'Cause the man I love 
            <br/>He don't treat me right
            </p>
         <p>
            <br/>He makes me feel so blue 
            <br/>I don't know what to do 
            <br/> Sometime I sit and sigh 
            <br/>And then begin to cry 
            <br/>'Cause my best friend said his last goodbye
            </p>
         <p>
            <br/>There's a change in the ocean
            <br/>Change in the deep blue sea, my baby 
            <br/>I'll tell you folks, there ain't no change in me

            <br/>Now I can read his letters
            <br/>I sure can't read his mind
            <br/>I thought he's lovin' me
            <br/>He's leavin' all the time
            <br/>Now I see my poor love was blind
            </p>

         <p>
            <br/>Now the doctor's gonna do all that he can
            <br/>But what you're gonna need is an undertaker man 
            <br/>I ain't had nothin' but bad news
            <br/>Now I got the crazy blues

         <h2> Golfing Papa </h2>
         <h2> Mamie Smith </h2>
         <p>
            <br/>Golfing Dan was a golfing man
            <br/>He'd golf from morn till night.
            <br/>He had a mama,a loving mama.
            <br/>He didn't treat her right.
            <br/>He'd come home, all tired out,
            <br/>And right to bed he'd go.
            <br/>His mama soon got tired of this,
            <br/>And these words she whispered low.
            </p>
         <p>
            <br/> She says, golfing papa you're way over par.
            <br/>You'll have to stop puttin on the green. 
            <br/>You've had your way on the fairway.
            <br/>You know just what I mean.
            </p>
         <p>
            <br/>Now, your stance is perfect,
            <br/>Your aim is true.
            <br/>But papa when you drive,
            <br/>You fail to follow through.
            </p>
         <p> 
            <br/> She says, golfing papa you're way over par.
            <br/>You'll have to stop puttin on the green.
            <br/>Use your niblick, you'll have to stop puttin on the green. 
            </p>
         <p> 
            <br/>Now what you need is a golfin coach,
            <br/>You're alright on your drive
            <br/>But bad on your approach. 
            <br/>What you want, your mama has got
            <br/>But son you'd better practice your explosion shot.
            </p>
         <p> 
            <br/>Now listen papa you must learn your stuff 
            <br/>Cause when you drive you slice, and go right in the rough.
            <br/>From paying green fees you've got me broke,
            <br/>Your shaft is bent and now you've lost your master stroke.
            </p>
         <p> 
            <br/>So pack your golf bags you've had your fun
            <br/>I foundanother man who made a hole in one.
            </p>
         <p> 
            <br/> She says, golfing papa you're way over par.
            <br/>You'll have to stop puttin on the green.
            <br/>Turn in your scorecard, you'll have to stop puttin on the green

            <br/>Every night and dayI hang my head and weep.
            <br/>Yes, and weep. 
            <br/>I love my baby, I want him for myself. 
            <br/>If he don't be mine, he won't have nobody else.
            <br/>He has left me, I do the best I can.
            <br/>I'm a do-right kid,get a friend and replace that man.

            <br/> My baby left me, it nearly killed me dead. 
            <br/>He went away, and never had a word to say.
            <br/>Now I'm worried, and lonesome deep down in my heart.
            <br/>Because I know the best of friends must part.
            <br/>He went away, it nearly breaks my heart.

            <br/>Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

            <br/>Stack O' Lee was a bad man 
            <br/>Everybody knows 
            <br/>And when they see Stack O' Lee comin'
            <br/>They'd give him the road 
            <br/>He was my man 
            <br/>But he done me wrong
            </p>
         <p>
            <br/>Stack O' Lee, Stack O' Lee 
            <br/>Was short-tempered and bad
            <br/>He'd take everything his women would bring
            <br/>And everything they had
            <br/>He was my man
            <br/>But he done me wrong
            </p>
         <p>
            <br/>Stack O' Lee's on the warpath
            <br/>And you'd better run 
            <br/>'Cause Stack O' Lee is a bad man
            <br/>And he'll kill you just for fun
            <br/>He was my man
            <br/>But he done you wrong
            </p>
         <p>
            <br/>Stack O' Lee's in jail now 
            <br/>With his face turned to the wall
            <br/>Pretty women and old corn whiskey 
            <br/>Was the cause of it all
            <br/>He was my man 
            <br/>But he done you wrong
            </p>
         <p>
            <br/>A hundred-dollar coffin 
            <br/>And a eighty-dollar hat
            <br/>Carriеd him to the cemetery 
            <br/>But it did not bring him back 
            <br/>He was my man 
            <br/>But he done me wrong
