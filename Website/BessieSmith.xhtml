                <h2>Bessie Smith</h2>
                <p>Bessie Smith (1894-1937) was both a protégée of Rainey’s and her rumored lover.
                    Much of her music focused on sex and relationships, as evidenced by her song “I
                    Used to Be Your Sweet Mama.” In Dr. Angela Davis’ Blues Legacies and Black
                    Feminism, she attributes a collective openness to sexual themes that rippled
                    into blues music to the newfound autonomy of Black women. “For the first time in
                    the history of African presence in North America, masses of black women and men
                    were in a position to make autonomous decisions regarding the sexual
                    partnerships in which they entered. Sexuality thus was one of the most tangible
                    domains in which emancipation was acted upon and through which meanings were
                    expressed.” Davis also discussed Smith’s specific use of call-and-response in
                    her songs as a method of conversation among women about male behavior. Both
                    Smith and Rainey transformed a musical characteristic—originating from West
                    African storytelling and later utilized by the blues to draw in audience
                    participation—into a feminist device.</p>
