                <h2>Bessie Smith</h2>
                <p>"Singer Bessie Smith's recording career lasted only 10 years, but during that
                    time she created a body of work that helped shape the sound of the 20th century.
                    Her first single, "Downhearted Blues" — written by two women, pianist Lovie
                    Austin and blues singer Alberta Hunter — was a major hit in 1923, selling
                    hundreds of thousands of copies and helping her label, Columbia Records, out of
                    a financial slump. With her subsequent recordings, Smith was one of the artists
                    who propelled the fledgling "race records" market of music targeted to black
                    audiences that had launched a few years earlier in 1920 with Mamie Smith's hit
                    "Crazy Blues." Through the rest of the 1920s, Bessie Smith became one of the
                    earliest stars of recorded music and a leading figure of what came to be called
                    classic blues (a genre dominated by African American women). She was the
                    highest-paid African American artist working in music and the first African
                    American superstar. Bessie Smith's sound and her attitude, rooted in a distant
                    era, are with us in the 21st century."</p>
