                <h2>Ma Rainey</h2>
                <p>"Businesswoman and entertainer Gertrude “Ma” Rainey, known as the Mother of
                    Blues, was the most popular blues singer/ songwriter of the 1920s. She is
                    considered to be the first woman to introduce blues into her performances. As a
                    single woman, she established her own entertainment company in 1917 and after a
                    successful career in vaudeville managed theaters in her home state of Georgia.
                    She was born Gertrude Pridgett in Columbus, Georgia, on April 26th, 1886 to
                    parents Thomas and Ella Pridgett. Rainey began singing and performing at a young
                    age: her first known public performance was at the age of 14 in a local talent
                    show. When she was 18 she married William “Pa” Rainey and began her career as a
                    performer for travelling minstrel and vaudeville shows. Between 1904 and 1917
                    Gertrude and Will Rainey toured with many groups, including the Rabbit Foot
                    Minstrels and the Tolliver Circus, until their marriage dissolved. At times they
                    billed themselves as “Rainey and Rainey, Assassinators of the Blues.” The Rainey
                    performances were more than just concerts, as they included drama and comedy
                    routines as well. This pattern of incorporating various styles of entertainment
                    were typical of early blues performers and other African American musicians of
                    the time. Rainey, as one of the earliest and most respected blues performers on
                    this scene, earned the title “Mother of the Blues.” After her marriage ended,
                    Rainey established her own company called Madame Gertrude Rainey and her Georgia
                    Smart Sets. Sometime between 1913 and 1916 Rainey met Bessie Smith, a younger
                    artist who sang with many of the same troupes and who may have been influenced
                    by Rainey’s singing style. The relationship between Rainey and Smith illustrates
                    the less conventional aspects of Rainey’s personal life: married twice, she made
                    no secret of her interest in a wide variety of young men, and there is some
                    evidence that she was also romantically inclined toward women. There were rumors
                    that Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith were lovers, and Rainey was once arrested after
                    being discovered by police in the company of several young women at a loud
                    party. Smith bailed her out of jail. Regardless of the true nature of their
                    relationship, which may never be known, this episode illustrates Rainey’s
                    larger-than-life personality, which was a key part of her music and onstage
                    persona and increased her popularity with both black and white Southern
                    audiences. After nearly twenty years of dramatic performances on the stage,
                    Rainey signed a contract with Paramount records in 1923, only three years after
                    the first blues recording was produced. She recorded almost 100 records between
                    1923 and 1928 with a wide variety of the best contemporary musicians, including
                    a young Louis Armstrong. During this period, she continued to travel and perform
                    across the South and occasionally in Chicago where she recorded. Other music
                    forms gained popularity in the late 1920s, and as the Great Depression set in
                    the demand for performers almost disappeared. Rainey retired to Columbus,
                    Georgia in 1935 after the death of her sister and mother. She managed theaters
                    in Columbus and Rome until her death in 1939 of heart failure."</p>
