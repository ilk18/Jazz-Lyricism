                <h2>Mamie Smith</h2>
                <p>"Mamie Smith made history when in 1920 she became the first African American
                    singer to make a record of a Blues song, “Crazy Blues.” The record became a
                    massive hit, changing the record industry and launching a new era of “race
                    records” aimed at black listeners. Born in 1883, Smith entered show business at
                    the tender age of ten. She spent the next decade working in vaudeville as dancer
                    and singer. At age 20 she married and settled down in New York City’s Harlem
                    neighborhood, where she became a regular performer in night clubs. On August 10,
                    1920, Smith filled in for an ailing Sophie Tucker, a white singer, at a
                    recording session for Okeh Records. One of the songs she cut that day, "Crazy
                    Blues," is widely viewed as the first Blues recording by an African-American
                    artist. It became a million-selling sensation, thanks in part to the large
                    numbers of copies sold in the African American community. This success surprised
                    record companies, who had underestimated the potential of the African-American
                    market. Quickly, record labels began making and marketing music specifically for
                    African American audiences, opening the door to many classic and influential
                    Blues and Jazz performances. Smith also opened the door to other prominent
                    “Blues Women” of the 1920s, including Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith. Smith made the
                    most of her “Crazy Blues” success, touring frequently in the United States and
                    Europe. She retired from performing in 1931, though beginning at the end of that
                    decade she returned to appear in a string of films. She died in New York City in
                    1946"</p>
