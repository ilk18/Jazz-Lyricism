                <h2>Mamie Smith</h2>
                <p>Mamie Smith (1891-1946) was the first African American artist to make a Blues
                    record in 1920 with her single “Crazy Blues.” “Crazy Blues” explores a woman’s
                    frustration, sadness and grief while experiencing mistreatment from her partner.
                    It spoke to the anger of Black Americans, especially after the “Red Summer” of
                    1919, marked by a rise in anti-Black violence and police brutality. The song was
                    immediately popular, selling tens of thousands of copies in the months after its
                    release. Smith was a trailblazer, her work not only proving that Black women
                    listened to and bought records, but that Black women singers could be leaders in
                    the music industry. Decades after her death, poet Maya Angelou spoke about how
                    going to the record store was “where I could wallow, rutting in music.” Smith’s
                    success supported the emergence of singers such as “Ma” Rainey and Bessie Smith
                    into popular culture. She started her career as a vaudeville entertainer,
                    touring with the Four Dancing Mitchells and enjoyed glamour, jewelry and
                    fashion.</p>
