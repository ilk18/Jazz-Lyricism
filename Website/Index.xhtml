        <p>"They hear it come out, but they don't know how it got there. They don't understand
            that's life's way of talking. You don't sing to feel better. You sing cause that's a way
            of understanding life."<sup>2</sup><br />
            Ma Rainey</p>
        <p>Welcome to our project that explores women in jazz! Our research focus explores the
            cultural perception of black women's lives and how they navigated through their struggles in
            this time period, told through jazz and blues music. We will be exploring the lives of
            three women in jazz, who happen to be Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith, and Mamie Smith. Through
            these women's voices we explore what women were experiencing during the golden age of
            jazz and how they navigated their struggles. </p>
