        <h1>Our Findings: Analysis and Data</h1>
        <h2>Portrayal of Gender</h2>
        <!-- chart 1 -->
        <div>
            <img src="images/GenderDescription.svg"
                alt="graph showcasing difference between when women are spoken of positively and negatively vs. men" />
            <p>This chart takes all of the descriptions of people across all songs and divides them
                into four categories. On the left, it shows that women were positively described
                seven times and negatively described five times. On the right side it shows that men
                were positively described five times and negatively described seven times. From this
                we can gather that though women and men are described in nearly equal amounts, women
                are more likely to be shown in a positive light and men are more likely to be shown
                in a negative light.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- chart 2 -->
        <div>
            <img src="images/ActivePassive.svg"
                alt="graph showcasing instances of activity vs passivity" />
            <p>This chart takes every instance that occurred of a woman taking some sort of action
                and breaks it down to which actions were active and passive. In this case, “active”
                is referring to any action that directly changed whatever situation that woman may
                have been in (i.e., standing up to an abusive partner or leaving town for a better
                life), and “passive” if referring to any action that did not directly change
                whatever situation that woman may have been in (i.e., crying over the loss of a
                relationship). </p>

            <p>As visible in this chart, when looking at women’s actions, the number of active
                choices made is more than double that of passive choices made. This shows that
                within these songs, the singers were primarily focused on telling stories of women
                who made active choices that impacted their lives. </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Relationships</h2>
        <!-- chart 3 -->
        <div>
            <img src="images/CauseFault.svg"
                alt="graph displaying the types of reasons for relationship ends and frequency of appearances for each" />
            <p>This chart takes every instance of the failure or end of a romantic relationship
                between a woman and a man and tracks the reason why it happened and how often it
                happened across all songs.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>“No Love” – Eight instances. Refers to cases where either both parties fell out
                    of love or in some cases just one party.</li>
                <li>“Abuse” – Two instances. Refers to the man abusing the woman, causing the
                    relationship to fail. There were no instances found of the relationship failing
                    due to the woman abusing the man.</li>
                <li>“Abandonment” – Fifteen instances. Refers to instances where the woman in the
                    relationship was abandoned by the man. </li>
                <li>“Money Troubles” – Zero instances. It was theorized by the researchers that
                    because of the large volume of mentions of money and socioeconomic status within
                    the songs that issues involving money might be the downfall for some of the
                    relationships in these songs, but that hypothesis was proven wrong, as no
                    romantic relationships were ended explicitly due to money troubles.</li>
                <li>“Event” – One instance. Refers to relationships ended due to events or the
                    ramifications of events out of either party’s control (i.e., a natural
                    disaster).</li>
                <li>“Cheating” – Three instances. Refers to cases where one party was found to be
                    cheating on the other and the relationship was then ended due to that
                    cheating.</li>
                <li>“Death” – Two instances. Refers to relationships ended due to the death of one
                    or both parties.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As evident, most relationships came to an end due to internal factors and feelings
                between parties and not due to outside forces. It is interesting to note that so
                many relationships ended due to abandonment, especially as many of the songs deal
                heavily with themes of loneliness.</p>
