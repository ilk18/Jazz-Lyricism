                <h2>Ma Rainey</h2>
                <p>Ma Rainey was born April 26th, 1866 to Thomas and Ella Pridgett in Georgia. She
                    loved singing from a young age had showed much promise, especially in her
                    teenage years. She married another performer nicknamed "Pa" Rainey in 1904 and
                    performed with him as a double act. However, their marriage came to an end after
                    almost 12 years and Ma Rainey developed her own show. Ma Rainey, also known as
                    the "mother of blues", rose to fame for her deep voice and amazing stage
                    presence. She was able to write her songs in a way that reflected her sexuality
                    and the way she navigated through life. Being a black female performer was not
                    easy and Ma Rainey often received low wages and small shows. Her segregated
                    audiences flocked to see her perform, especially after her contract with
                    Paramount Records that happened in 1923. In her songs, she sings about
                    sexuality, depression, and other facets of life that she experienced. She
                    inspired many blues singers, especially Bessie Smith.</p>
