        <line-start/>Spendin' my money, I didn't care
            <!-- change to status="lost" because through buying things the singer is losing money-->
        <line-start/>I carried my friends out for a good time

        <line-start/>I didn't have a friend and no place to go
        <line-start/>But if I ever get my hands on a dollar again
        <line-start/>I'm gonna hold on to it 'til them eagles grin

        <!-- i would change status to ="static" because the line isn't describing the singer losing any money, just that she has none -->
        <line-start/>And my friends, I haven't any

    <verse>
        <line-start/>But if I ever get on my feet again
        <line-start/>And I'll meet my long-lost friend
        <line-start/>It's mighty strange without a doubt
        <line-start/>Nobody knows you when you down and out
        <line-start/>I mean, when you down and out

        <line-start/>Mmm
        <line-start/>When you down and out

           <!-- same status="static" comment as above -->
        <line-start/>And my friends, I haven't any
    </verse>    
    <verse>
        <line-start/>Mmm, and I fell so low
        <line-start/><relationship atmosphere="negative">Nobody wants me 'round their door
        <line-start/>Mmm, without a doubt
        <line-start/>No man can use you when you down and out</relationship>
        <line-start/>I mean when you down and out
