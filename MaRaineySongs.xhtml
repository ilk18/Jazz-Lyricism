         <h2>Nobody Knows when You're Down and Out</h2>
         <h2>Bessie Smith</h2>
         <p>
            <br/>Once I lived a life of a millionaire
            <br/>Spendin' my money, I didn't care
            <br/>I carried my friends out for a good time
            <br/>Buy bootleg liquor, champagne, and wine
            </p>
         <p>
            <br/>When I begin to fall so low
            <br/>I didn't have a friend and no place to go
            <br/>But if I ever get my hands on a dollar again
            <br/>I'm gonna hold on to it 'til them eagles grin
            </p>
         <p>
            <br/>Nobody knows you
            <br/>When you down and out
            <br/>In my pocket not one penny
            <br/>And my friends, I haven't any
            </p>
         <p>
            <br/>But if I ever get on my feet again
            <br/>And I'll meet my long-lost friend
            <br/>It's mighty strange without a doubt
            <br/>Nobody knows you when you down and out
            <br/>I mean, when you down and out
            </p>
         <p>
            <br/>Mmm
            <br/>When you down and out
            <br/>Mmm, not one penny
            <br/>And my friends, I haven't any
            </p>
         <p>
            <br/>Mmm, and I fell so low
            <br/>Nobody wants me 'round their door
            <br/>Mmm, without a doubt
            <br/>No man can use you when you down and out
            <br/>I mean when you down and out
            </p>

         <h2>Aggravatin Papa</h2>
         <h2>Bessie Smith</h2>
         <p>
            <br/>I know a triflin' man
            <br/>They call him Triflin' Sam
            <br/>He lives in Birmingham
            <br/>Way down in Alabam'
            </p>
         <p>
            <br/>Now the other night
            <br/>He had a fight
            <br/>With a gal named Mandy Brymm
            <br/>She plainly stated she was aggravated
            <br/>And she shouted out to him
            </p>
         <p>
            <br/>Aggravatin' papa, don't you try to two-time me
            <br/>I said, don't two-time me
            <br/>Aggravatin' papa, treat me kind or let me be
            <br/>I mean, just let me be
            </p>
         <p>
            <br/>Listen while I get you told
            <br/>Stop messin' round, sweet jellyroll
            <br/>If you stay out with a high-brown baby
            <br/>I'll smack you down, and I don't mean maybe
            </p>
         <p>
            <br/>Aggravatin' papa, I'll do anything you say
            <br/>Anything you say
            <br/>But when you go struttin', do your strut around my way
            <br/>So papa, just treat me pretty, be nice and kind
            <br/>The way you treated me will make me lose my mind
            <br/>Aggravatin' papa, don't you try to two-time me
            </p>
         <p>
            <br/>Just treat me pretty, be nice and sweet
            <br/>I got a darn forty-four that don't repeat
            <br/>Aggravatin' papa, don't you try to two-time me
            </p>

            <br/>Gee, but it's hard to love someone when that someone don't love you!
            <br/>I'm so disgusted, heart-broken, too; I've got those down-hearted blues;
            <br/>Once I was crazy 'bout a man; he mistreated me all the time
            <br/>The next man I get has got to promise me to be mine, all mine!
            </p>
         <p>
            <br/>Trouble, trouble, I've had it all my days
            <br/>Trouble, trouble, I've had it all my days;
            <br/>It seems like trouble going to follow me to my grave
            </p>
         <p>
            <br/>I ain't never loved but three men in my life;
            <br/>I ain't never loved but three men in my life:
            <br/>My father, my brother, the man that wrecked my life
            </p>
         <p>
            <br/>It may be a week, it may be a month or two
            <br/>It may be a week, it may be a month or two
            <br/>But the day you quit me, honey, it's comin' home to you
            </p>
         <p>
            <br/>I got the world in a jug, the stopper's in my hand
            <br/>I got the world in a jug, the stopper's in my hand
            <br/>I'm gonna hold it until you meet some of my demands

            <br/>I hate to see the evening'sun go down 
            <br/>It makes me think I'm on my last go 'round

         <p>
            <br/>Saint Louis woman with her diamond rings 
            <br/>Pulls that man around by her apron strings 
            <br/>Wasn't for powder and the store-bought hair
            <br/>The man I love wouldn't go nowhere, nowhere</p>
         <p>
            <br/>I got them Saint Louis Blues; just as blue as I can be 
            <br/>He's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
            <br/>Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me
