<Methodology>
    <body> First, for our project we decided to break up the meta data by labeling it with "title",
        "written-by", "performed-by", and "publish-date". We also added "moral" within the metadata.
        so that a reader can look at a song based on a particular theme if they wanted to.We added
        this because it makes it easier for the reader and us, so that the information is easily
        accesible. Next, we performed hierachical markup on the songs by adding "song",
        "line-start", and "verse" tags. Because we did this, the song becomes easier to navigate for
        the user and makes the layout more clean. We also added primary content tags, which contain
        tags such as "action", "description", and "cause". This allows us and the reader to easiloy
        identify the action that is being done by the singer or another party in the song. It allows
        us to describe what is happening, so that the event is made clear. Finally, It allows us and
        the reader to explore the cause of the action. In order for us to describe the cause of an
        action, we created three secondary content tags, which are "mental-health", "relationship",
        and "money". By creating all of these categories, we will be able to create data that
        relates to our primary research focus which is: "The cultural perception of black women's
        lives and struggles and how they navigated them in this time period, told through jazz and
        blues music". For example, the data will allow us to find what was thought most to affect
        these women's lives, such as a person, money, or something else.</body>
